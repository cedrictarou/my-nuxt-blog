# Mastering VueJS
### My learning notes on Vue (version 3)
## Installation Types

- CDN
- NPM
- CLI (Preferred)
- Vite

## CLI Installation
The cli installation is easy but requires prior knowledge of NodeJS.

### Installing the CLI is as easy as running the following command in your terminal (requires node/npm to be installed).

```sh
yarn global add @vue/cli
# OR
npm install -g @vue/cli
```
